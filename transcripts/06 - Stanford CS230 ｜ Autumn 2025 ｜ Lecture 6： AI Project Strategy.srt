1
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:11,640
So what I want to do today is continue our discussion on AI project strategy.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,879
So if you're building a deep learning system for some tasks, and today, for the first

3
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:22,640
part of today, I'm going to use a speech recognition, voice-activated device example.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,280
And then for the second half, I'm going to use a kind of AI deep researcher example.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,439
But what I want to do is walk you through a couple of concrete examples of projects

6
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,799
you might work on and let you understand what it feels like to be in the thick of

7
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,840
building an AI system, making day-to-day decisions on what to do next.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
I find that, I think as you've heard me say before, understanding the

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,399
algorithms is important, so in this class, you learn a lot from the

10
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,119
online videos about the deep learning algorithms, how to build pipelines.

11
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,880
But even beyond understanding how the algorithms work, what really drives

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,079
performance is a team's ability to have an efficient development process.

13
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,359
How do you tune how the parameters, how do you collect data?

14
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,319
When you try something and it doesn't work the first time, which it often

15
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,760
doesn't, what do you do next?

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
Your skill at making those decisions is what often makes a massive,

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,040
literally 10x difference in productivity.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,599
And as I was reflecting, was preparing for what to say to you today,

19
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,099
I was reflecting on quite a few projects where that 10x difference in

20
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,760
productivity is really not an exaggeration, right?

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,959
Maybe more than 10x, but I've literally seen many teams in many well-known

22
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,680
companies with good brands spend a year at work on a project that I will

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,640
see a more skilled team execute in like a month, right?

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
So these differences in skill are real.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,200
And one of the challenges for new people learning this is if you

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,560
work for some company, maybe you work on a different project every year or two,

27
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,560
right? But so it takes you like, you know, two years of two years or a year of your

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,799
life to gain experience on one more project.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,719
And then after, I don't know, 10 years, you finally seen 10 projects

30
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,879
and a pretty experience.

31
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,479
But what I want to do is in today's class, walk you through a few

32
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,520
concrete examples of projects that similar to want to kind of simplify

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,879
versions of stuff that I've seen myself to try to accelerate your hands

34
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,919
on experience, looking at these projects and thinking through.

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,879
If you are the one in the hot seat building a system and it works or

36
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,159
doesn't work or this problem, whatever, making those decisions for what you

37
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,080
would do. So try to get you through that today.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,680
We'll have a couple of examples rather than you having to spend years

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,240
and years of your life to finally see a small number of examples of how

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,120
these projects can be driven.

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,360
Right? So the first motive, the first of the two motivating examples

42
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:00,639
I'm going to use today is building a voice activated device in my house.

43
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,199
I have, you know, like a Amazon Echo, right?

44
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,400
I have a lot of them actually.

45
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,879
And I think it's a delightful experience, but those devices like

46
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,680
that, Amazon Echo or Google Home or the Apple Siri HomePods, they

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240
require quite a bit of setup, right?

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,159
They require some setup, connect to the wifi, figure out a way to

49
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,199
connect to your phone, blah.

50
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,240
And so, you know, actually for a long time, even though I built smart

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,000
speakers, for a long time in my house, I had one light bulb connected

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
to my home wifi internet, you know, because it's just so much of

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,560
a hassle to set things up.

54
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,280
I think now I have two light bulbs connected in my house.

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,319
I guess I should connect my stuff.

56
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,520
But so for this motive example, I want to talk about if you are

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,800
part of a startup, building a new product that makes it much easier

58
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,840
to get these voice control devices without the user needing to do

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,360
this whole wifi setup process.

60
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:10,560
So, you know, I'm not very good at drawing, but if you could go to

61
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,800
some store and buy a desk lamp and the desk lamp already has a name,

62
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,560
let's call this lamp Robert, and you could just take it, plug it into

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,279
the electricity, plug it into your desk, and then say, Robert, turn

64
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,560
on, and then it turns on, say, Robert, turn on, then it turns off

65
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,079
without needing to be connected to the internet, to the cloud

66
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,000
access and all that.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,079
Then that would give users an easier setup experience.

68
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,879
There's a project that my friends and I actually discussed a

69
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,120
few years ago that we thought would actually be a decent startup

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,439
idea.

71
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,519
We decided not to do it because there are too many other ideas

72
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,560
that we're even more excited about.

73
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,199
But we felt that actually, you know, like a reasonable, reasonable

74
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
startup idea to build a little IC circuit, little integrated

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
circuit, to sell to say, lamp manufacturers and other device

76
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
manufacturers to make it really easy if, say, some company

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,199
sells lamps to build little things so they can very quickly

78
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
make their devices voice enabled.

79
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,399
And if you have a few pre-built names, maybe give the

80
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,759
users a choice, you can call it lamp Robert or Lainer, you

81
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,600
know, or, I don't know, or Johnny or, I don't know,

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,959
Alice or whatever, have a little switch.

83
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,279
Then users could just buy a lamp, put it down, and then

84
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,839
immediately have it be voice controlled without needing to

85
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,120
worry about how do you get this onto my Wi-Fi network?

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,920
And if my internet is down, then my whole house stays

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,000
dark as well because all things like that, right?

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,000
And I actually did once have an, I was building a lot

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
of voice assistants, I actually set up my office to

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
have a lot of voice control devices.

91
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
So I had different names with different lamps, standing

92
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,399
desk is his name as well, so I'd say, I forget what my

93
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,120
desk name was, you know, like, you know, Jonathan, go

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
higher or whatever, and then my standing desk would go

95
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,759
up and down.

96
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,560
It's actually pretty cool.

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
So what I want you to, so just for today's

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,920
illustration, probably we should give the different

99
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,279
devices different names because you can't have every

100
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,040
device in your house called Robert.

101
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,120
Otherwise, they say Robert turn on the whole house

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
illuminates and Robert turn off whole houses plunged into

103
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,720
the darkness.

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,519
So we found out you do need different devices to

105
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,240
have different names.

106
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,120
But just for today, I'm going to use as illustration,

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,879
the task of creating a neural network or building

108
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,000
a system that detects when someone says Robert

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
turn on, and you need kind of Robert turn on,

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,480
Robert turn off.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,800
If you have a choice, it needs to be Lena turn on,

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Lena turn off and a variety of handful of options

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,000
of names.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
But just a simplicity, I'm going to worry only about

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,720
detecting the phrase Robert turn on, right?

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
And what do we do for this?

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,839
You can rinse and repeat to get the turn off

118
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,399
command and a handful of other names to make it

119
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,600
user selectable.

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
What, you know, what name do you want to give this

121
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,079
thing?

122
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, so this is something they'll need to run on

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,199
device, small IC circuits, and Mike, and I'm going

124
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
to ask you a question, right?

125
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,120
When you've graduated from CS230, or maybe when

126
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,079
you graduated from Stanford, if you are the

127
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,439
CTO of a startup responsible for building

128
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,560
this, what would you do?

129
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Right?

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,519
So call out.

131
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,160
So imagine you just graduated from CS230 or

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
just graduate from Stanford, and you're the CTO

133
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,920
of a startup, and you want to build this lamp that

134
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,639
can turn on when anyone says Robert turn on.

135
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,480
How would you approach this problem?

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,560
And I know this is an incredibly open-ended

137
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
question, and it turns out life is incredibly

138
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,639
open-ended, right?

139
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,120
You graduate from CS230, you have to decide

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,920
what to do.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,480
So if this is what you're doing, if you're

142
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,160
going to raise your hand and call out, if you

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,279
want to build this product, what's the first

144
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,839
thing you do?

145
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,879
How would you think about it?

146
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,790
Go for it.

147
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:22,019
Yeah, cool.

148
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:22,420
Yeah, right.

149
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,660
So get some like an open-source speech-to-text

150
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,019
model or something, and let's see if you can

151
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:26,259
write it.

152
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,220
Yeah, that would be a good start.

153
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,139
Anything else?

154
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:30,579
Go ahead.

155
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,360
All right, sorry.

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
Three models, one that detects Robert, and

157
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:59,590
then one that I see.

158
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,909
I see.

159
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:00,149
Cool.

160
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:00,389
Right.

161
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,629
Okay.

162
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:00,870
Right.

163
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,830
So the three models to detect Robert,

164
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,590
understand their sentence, or detecting

165
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,990
the sound.

166
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,110
Cool.

167
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,509
Go for it.

168
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:09,730
All right.

169
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,129
Oh, sorry.

170
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:10,690
Say again?

171
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,039
It's like a sign-means network.

172
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,559
We actually teach a sign-means network

173
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,559
related to this class, where something

174
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,000
that inputs two audio files and decides

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,960
they're saying the same words.

176
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,879
So you can more easily generalize the

177
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,639
new words than the Robert.

178
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:55,879
Cool.

179
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,399
Now that's actually pretty interesting.

180
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah, go for it.

181
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh, sorry.

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
You mean just connect up your device

183
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
to Siri?

184
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:37,679
I see.

185
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,240
Okay, cool.

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,720
Yeah.

187
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,960
Right.

188
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,679
Yeah.

189
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,480
That sounds interesting.

190
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,919
It sounds like a different product

191
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,679
than this if we need to connect to

192
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,039
the cell phone and all that though.

193
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:45,919
Yeah.

194
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,240
Cool.

195
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,480
Right.

196
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,600
So let me just, lots of interesting

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,240
ideas.

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
Let me just make some observations.

199
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,759
So I find that when building software

200
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,440
products, there are actually lots of

201
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,519
good ideas or lots of reasonable things

202
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,080
you could try.

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,399
But, you know, as you heard me

204
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,759
mention a few weeks ago, I think one

205
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,840
of the strongest predictors for the

206
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,759
odds of you building something compelling

207
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,879
is speed.

208
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,440
So I find that of all of these ideas,

209
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,799
I think some are better than others,

210
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,600
but it doesn't, but whether the idea

211
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
is, you know, a bit better, a little

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
bit worse, it is important.

213
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
But it's actually secondary to how

214
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,000
quickly you can just get something

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,720
built.

216
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
So if you're actually the CTO of a

217
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
startup like this, I encourage you to

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,919
look and say, all right, what can

219
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,840
we build today?

220
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
Or what can we build maybe in a week?

221
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,039
And try any of these architecture

222
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,320
choices and build it

223
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,080
and see what happens.

224
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
Because even if what you build is a

225
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,080
little bit less, you know, good,

226
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,799
you can find out all in two days,

227
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,679
you know, leaving the course

228
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,799
correct very quickly.

229
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,039
I've actually worked, I've actually

230
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,399
built a lot of smart speakers.

231
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,840
So I have maybe firsthand experience

232
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,879
of this and I just share some

233
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,080
things that I happen to know that

234
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,279
there's no reason you would know.

235
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,159
But it turns out that, let's see,

236
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,080
at least today, general purpose

237
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,559
speech recognition is still a little

238
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,000
bit heavyweight.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,159
Takes quite a lot of, you know,

240
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,360
processing power is a bit expensive

241
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,879
to run on an edge device.

242
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,080
If you want to make this like

243
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,960
just a few dollars.

244
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,519
But it turns out that if you look

245
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,240
at the smart speakers, there's

246
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
usually, if you want to train

247
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,039
a neural network just to detect

248
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,919
one phrase, be it a phrase like,

249
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,759
you know, okay, Google, or hey,

250
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,679
Siri, or Alexa, or whatever.

251
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,879
And if the smart speaker

252
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,879
trigger words, that can be done

253
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,120
with a fairly small neural network.

254
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
Although to your point, if we want

255
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,519
to do different neural networks,

256
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
different words, we'll need to swap

257
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
out different neural networks.

258
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm going to repeat that.

259
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,039
But if you have only a small

260
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,799
handful of names, phrases,

261
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,639
one to ten, I think that'd be okay.

262
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,080
And then one other piece of advice

263
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,559
I would give, if you're embarking

264
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,000
on this, is the first thing I

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
would do actually, if I was working

266
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
on this for the first time, is

267
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,759
actually a literature search.

268
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,919
And it turns out that, you know,

269
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,679
I think we're fortunate that the AI

270
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,440
world has a ton of open-source

271
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,159
software and a ton of open

272
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:14,960
research papers.

273
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,519
Somewhat surprisingly, despite

274
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,480
smart speakers haven't been

275
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
around for a long time,

276
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,759
there still, to this day, isn't

277
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,440
like a single architecture that

278
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,039
everyone's agreed on, on the

279
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,000
best way to do this.

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,279
If you look at the literature,

281
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,080
there's still actually a

282
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,639
diversity of opinions on how to do

283
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
this type of wake word or trigger

284
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
word, which is so sensitive.

285
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,159
So when you say something like,

286
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,399
yeah, okay, Google, or Hey Siri,

287
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,759
or Alexa, that's sometimes called

288
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,039
a wake word because it wakes up

289
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,320
the device, or trigger word,

290
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
triggers the device to take

291
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,799
activity. So somewhat

292
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,759
surprisingly, even though we

293
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,279
have smart speakers for a long

294
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,200
time now, for more than a decade,

295
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,519
there still isn't a single agreed

296
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
on unified architecture that

297
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,480
the committee has agreed on,

298
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,600
and what's the best algorithm

299
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,159
to do this. But I feel like

300
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
if you are embarking on this

301
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,559
for the first time, the number

302
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,039
one boost in your speed of

303
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,399
learning, it could be

304
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,919
implementing something, but I

305
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,960
would say doing a literature

306
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,159
search and trying open source

307
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,759
software would be the even

308
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,960
faster accelerator.

309
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,120
And I want to give you a few

310
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,000
tips for that, right?

311
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Real quick. So, you know,

312
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,480
today, if this is, there are

313
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,919
a lot of research articles

314
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,399
and blog posts and GitHub repos

315
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,879
on many topics, certainly wake

316
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,639
word detection. And what I

317
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,559
find is that if this is

318
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,840
research paper one, research

319
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
paper two, research paper

320
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,159
three, research paper four,

321
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
I find that, you know,

322
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,159
sometimes people will spend

323
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,039
a lot of time reading

324
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,320
research paper one until

325
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,679
you're done, right?

326
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,960
It's zero percent complete,

327
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,759
it's a hundred percent

328
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,200
complete. And then spend

329
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,000
a lot of time reading

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,840
research paper two, spend

331
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,559
a lot of time reading

332
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,639
research paper three, and I

333
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,879
just recommend you not do

334
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,279
that. Instead, when I'm

335
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,399
doing a literature search,

336
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,159
what it often feels like is,

337
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,200
you know, do a few web

338
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
searches for a handful

339
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
of resources, skim all

340
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,919
of them, zero percent

341
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,799
complete, hundred percent

342
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,519
complete, right?

343
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,639
Basically initial reading,

344
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,600
you may decide to go back

345
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,720
to paper three and spend

346
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,919
more time to really read

347
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,120
and understand that.

348
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
But that'll help you find

349
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,679
additional references,

350
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,879
you can skim and maybe

351
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,320
you find that paper seven

352
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,919
that's really seminal,

353
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,960
spend a lot of effort.

354
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,720
But this is what doing

355
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
a very broad survey of

356
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
the literature will feel like,

357
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
where, you know, you're

358
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
really putting the time

359
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,279
to finish only a very small

360
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,360
number of resources, but spend

361
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,559
a lot more time skipping

362
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,279
around and getting a

363
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,120
cursory level understanding

364
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,879
of a broader set of papers,

365
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,039
which can also point you

366
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,440
to also point you

367
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
to the more useful resources

368
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,399
to focus attention on.

369
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,559
And just one thing

370
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,600
I've seen among Stanford

371
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
students, there's one

372
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,759
other thing that I find

373
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,159
people tend to under use,

374
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,000
which is trying to talk

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,519
to experts. So if you are

376
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,559
actually a seat at a start,

377
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm trying to build this

378
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,840
for the first time.

379
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,399
I feel like, you know,

380
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,759
we all want to do our own work

381
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,879
and not bother other people,

382
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,759
which is good.

383
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,720
But I just encourage you

384
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
to consider if

385
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
after you've done your own work,

386
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
if reach out to an expert

387
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,159
can really survey your learning.

388
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,000
So something I've often done is,

389
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,519
you know, I will do my own work.

390
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,039
I don't call random experts

391
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,840
to try to bother them

392
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,360
before I've at least done my work.

393
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
But if you've sometimes

394
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,399
I'm reading a paper,

395
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,279
I'm really struggling

396
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,720
to understand it.

397
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,159
And I find that instead of me

398
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,679
struggling for another like

399
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,639
four hours, if I send the authors

400
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,679
a respectful email

401
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,159
and say, hey, I read your paper,

402
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,679
try to understand this.

403
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,879
I'm still confused.

404
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,679
Can you help me out?

405
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,639
Can you explain this to me?

406
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,440
A lot of the time,

407
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
including when, you know,

408
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,919
I was less well known, right?

409
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,519
But I think a lot of people,

410
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,240
if they see that

411
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,120
you're doing your work

412
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,399
and not just reaching out to them

413
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,320
before you've even done anything,

414
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,840
a lot of them, not everyone,

415
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,320
but a lot of research authors

416
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,159
would actually be quite, you know,

417
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,919
understanding and then

418
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,880
try to help you out.

419
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,519
And so I find that

420
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,720
for a lot of projects I did,

421
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,000
finding that one expert,

422
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
sometimes a Stanford professor,

423
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
actually we have a lot of speech faculty

424
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,920
and the Stanford faculty as well.

425
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
But when I had problems

426
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,440
with my speech recognition system,

427
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,039
you know, sometimes I call like,

428
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,039
you know, Dan Jurowski, whatever.

429
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
And then like a half hour conversation

430
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
or even a 10 minute conversation

431
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,680
really accelerates

432
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
what I've been able to do.

433
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,440
So I just encourage you to,

434
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,359
it takes you like 10 minutes

435
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,480
to send an email

436
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,079
and maybe there's a 50% chance

437
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,519
of response, I don't know, right?

438
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,480
Not a high spin chance,

439
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
but sometimes that tends to be

440
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,799
really high ROI, right?

441
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,359
And then what I think you find

442
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,599
is that if you do

443
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,480
a literature search,

444
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,880
you will likely discover

445
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
that most of the robust enterprise

446
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
grade smart speaker systems

447
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,079
all have a specialized system

448
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,319
trained to detect the wake word

449
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,359
or the trigger word, right?

450
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,400
And again, there's a variety

451
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,599
of architectures.

452
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,400
You probably come up

453
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,519
with some good neural network

454
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,559
architectures for this.

455
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,759
And oh, it turns out that

456
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,599
there is no data set on the internet

457
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,559
with lots of people

458
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,759
saying Robert turned on, right?

459
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,279
That's just not a thing, right?

460
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,559
So if you decide that the names

461
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,480
are Robert and Lainer and,

462
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,759
you know, I don't know,

463
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,000
Jeremy and Alicia or whatever,

464
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,920
sorry, the people of those real names.

465
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,880
It was actually kind of weird

466
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,319
when we chose people's names,

467
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,160
but we chose that for some reason.

468
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,039
But it turns out that

469
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,960
there is no large data set

470
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
on the internet of lots of people

471
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,359
saying Robert turned on.

472
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,920
So if you want to train a neural network

473
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,079
to detect if someone has said this phrase,

474
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,480
you need to collect that data yourself, right?

475
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,039
So let me then ask you

476
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,839
another question.

477
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,880
Say you've done a literature search,

478
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,640
found some open source code

479
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,119
you can try,

480
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,200
but that has led you,

481
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,319
say to conclude that

482
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,759
you need data sets

483
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,359
of people saying Robert turned on.

484
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,759
Oh, you need a data set to train

485
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,200
to distinguish between

486
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,480
someone saying Robert turned on

487
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,319
versus not someone saying Robert turned on.

488
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
How would you approach

489
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,079
getting a data set like that?

490
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,559
So yeah, go for it.

491
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,750
Text-to-speech.

492
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:18,339
Yeah, cool.

493
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:18,819
Yeah, yep.

494
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,660
You use text-to-speech as one method.

495
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,140
I'll come back to that later.

496
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,019
So you need that, yes.

497
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,450
Oh, sorry.

498
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,950
Yep, cool.

499
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,829
Yep, I like that.

500
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,750
So walk around and ask people,

501
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,549
tell them what you're doing,

502
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,509
get the permission to record

503
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,230
and use their voice,

504
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,390
and if they're okay giving permission,

505
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,509
just record their voices.

506
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,230
Yeah, I like that.

507
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:45,750
Anything else?

508
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:48,769
Cool.

509
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,319
Oh, sorry.

510
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,960
Can you say that again?

511
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:17,750
Yep, cool.

512
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:21,890
Yeah, yep, cool.

513
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,289
Yep, right.

514
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,730
So samples of people

515
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,089
saying not Robert turned on.

516
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,049
I agree, yeah, cool.

517
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:46,470
I see, cool.

518
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,029
Actually, you're right.

519
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,430
So the data is what people are saying Robert,

520
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,710
but you don't want that to be mistaken.

521
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,349
That's a good point.

522
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:54,390
I'll come back to that later.

523
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,589
Yes.

524
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,309
Did I say something?

525
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,990
Oh, same thing.

526
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,549
Oh, interesting.

527
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,789
Cool.

528
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:59,190
Awesome.

529
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,990
Great.

530
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,470
All right.

531
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,869
So one of the...

532
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,710
Yes, so I really like the idea

533
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,829
of just going around

534
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:09,190
and asking people for permission

535
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,390
to record their voices.

536
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,349
And then, by the way,

537
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,190
in today's world privacy is important.

538
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,150
Consent is important.

539
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,869
So don't do anything sneaky or weird.

540
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,190
Just tell people clearly what you're doing,

541
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,869
ask them for permission,

542
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,950
make sure any permission is freely given,

543
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,190
and if they don't give permission, it's fine.

544
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,509
We won't.

545
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,869
I really respect people's privacy.

546
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,390
That is really important.

547
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,190
Having said that,

548
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,950
I find that a lot of people in the world

549
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,750
are very nice.

550
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,390
Not everyone,

551
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,829
but the vast majority of people in the world

552
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:34,710
seem very nice.

553
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,829
And if you ask them nicely,

554
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,430
I know this because I've done this myself.

555
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,710
They won't give permission

556
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,789
for you to provide their data.

557
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,630
And then just one of the framing

558
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,990
I encourage you to think about as always

559
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,869
is the speed.

560
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:49,910
So how long will it take you

561
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,750
to wander around campus

562
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,269
or wander around San Francisco

563
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,269
and collect a sample of voices?

564
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:56,710
And I think you actually get a lot done.

565
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,869
You'll get many dozens of samples,

566
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,230
maybe hundreds of samples

567
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,509
easily in a day.

568
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,589
So I think those are good tactics.

569
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,670
And then let me share with you some things.

570
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:10,309
It turns out synthetic data

571
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:11,750
using text-to-speech

572
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,269
is an interesting tactic.

573
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,470
I would usually not use that

574
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,910
as the first thing I do,

575
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,230
mainly because it turns out

576
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:23,430
it's hard to know

577
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,589
how accurate synthetic data is

578
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:31,910
compared to true natural data.

579
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,789
And maybe just show you

580
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:33,750
one thing I've run into.

581
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,750
I've actually done a lot of synthetic data

582
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,269
for speech recognition, right?

583
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,789
One thing you have to watch out for is

584
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,349
if it goes to a lot of the synthetic

585
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:43,190
sources of data,

586
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,430
how many voices,

587
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,630
how many different voices

588
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,910
does it provide?

589
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,750
And is it going to be a pain

590
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,390
to get enough diversity

591
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,910
in different people's voices?

592
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,910
So it turns out, I don't know,

593
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,390
for example, I often talk to

594
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,950
open that voice on my phone

595
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,990
instead of typing,

596
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,549
but the number of voices there is limited.

597
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,549
And if you go to TTS provider,

598
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,069
I guess there are now some services

599
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:09,349
with a larger number of voices,

600
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:09,990
but these are things

601
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,950
you end up worrying about.

602
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,710
And it's all solvable.

603
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,950
Synthetic data does work

604
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,549
for speech recognition, right?

605
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:18,789
But it turns out that they're often

606
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:22,069
enough details associated with filling

607
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,069
with the synthetic data generation process

608
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,549
and that ends up taking longer.

609
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:29,670
So for a lot of machine learning applications,

610
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,630
using synthetic data is a good idea.

611
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,750
And eventually you might get around to it,

612
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,109
but using synthetic data

613
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,349
is usually not the first type of data

614
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:40,150
I would collect

615
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,230
because usually there's just

616
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,509
too many hyperparameters

617
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,789
and too many knobs

618
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,069
you have to worry about.

619
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:47,670
And then at the back of your head,

620
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,630
you may be wondering

621
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,509
whether there's something

622
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:52,230
weird about the synthetic data

623
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,589
that I had not thought of before.

624
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,630
Whereas you collect natural data,

625
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,829
collect real data,

626
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:01,029
it's just one less thing to worry about.

627
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,630
Maybe just to tell one more story,

628
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:06,390
not in speech,

629
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,710
but self-driving cars, right?

630
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,910
So you're building self-driving cars,

631
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,109
you want to detect other cars.

632
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:13,829
Where do you get pictures of cars?

633
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,509
It turns out that a lot of people

634
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,269
will have the idea of,

635
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:20,630
oh, there are lots of video games

636
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,309
with cars driving around.

637
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:23,750
Why don't we use video games

638
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,950
to get pictures of cars

639
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,910
out of the video game?

640
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,349
But it turns out a problem

641
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,269
with a lot of video games is

642
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,190
there could be like 20 different cars

643
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,309
in the entire video game.

644
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,670
It depends on the video game.

645
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,470
But it turns out that

646
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,990
to have a realistic video game,

647
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:40,869
you don't need a thousand different cars

648
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,069
and there are tons of different

649
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,670
car designs on the road,

650
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,829
but you need a very narrow set of cars.

651
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:46,869
And so to a human,

652
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,349
seeing the same 20 cars over and over

653
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,190
and looking at the road looks fine,

654
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,630
the video game plays fine.

655
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,990
But for a lot of video games,

656
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,869
the data just isn't rich enough

657
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,910
to capture anywhere near

658
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,750
the richness of the real world.

659
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,710
Whereas in contrast,

660
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,910
if you've got real pictures,

661
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,950
there's just one less thing

662
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,069
you have to worry about, right?

663
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,589
So I find that for synthetic data,

664
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:09,109
it works, it's very valuable to use it a lot,

665
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,269
but I usually get to it

666
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:12,549
only later in the process.

667
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:13,509
Does that make sense?

668
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,789
Cool, something.

669
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,309
And then in the interest

670
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:22,150
of building these things quickly,

671
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,990
let me share with you

672
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,109
the types of things

673
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,950
that my teams have done

674
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,470
to collect data for this, right?

675
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,269
And I feel like when you

676
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:32,470
read research papers

677
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,789
or you take courses,

678
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:37,509
often you get a very clean view of data.

679
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:38,390
I'm going to tell you

680
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,309
about one of the weird random hacks

681
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:45,509
that one of my teams has used to build

682
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:46,710
like a very serious,

683
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,589
working really well

684
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,869
commercial system, right?

685
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:50,390
And at least that's part

686
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,430
of the journey to do so,

687
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,150
which is, let's see.

688
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:07,859
So collected 100 training audio clips

689
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,380
and 25 development sets to tune to

690
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,740
and zero tests, right?

691
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,180
One thing I'll often do

692
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,059
if my main goal

693
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,579
is to just build a system that works

694
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,980
as opposed to publish a research paper

695
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,420
is to not have a test set.

696
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,619
We just have a dev set

697
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,140
that we will tune the parameters to.

698
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,180
And if I want to publish a research paper,

699
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,140
I probably need a clean,

700
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,579
unbiased test set.

701
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:34,579
But if my goal is to just build something

702
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,339
and have it work and ship it,

703
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,859
sometimes I just say,

704
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:38,660
I'm not going to bother

705
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,019
to collect any test data.

706
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,859
Just a training set and a dev set

707
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:44,819
and I just unapologetically

708
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,140
tune my system to the dev set, right?

709
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,500
And one thing you could do is,

710
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:56,630
let's see.

711
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,509
So audio clips.

712
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,069
So audio is, let's see.

713
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:06,309
So you may have seen the audio waveforms, right?

714
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:07,430
Which ones is time,

715
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,109
you know, x-axis is time

716
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:10,789
and audio waveforms kind of

717
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:13,109
are these wiggly time series.

718
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,190
Right, and sound is very rapid

719
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,630
vibrations in the air

720
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,190
that your ear perceives that sound.

721
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,390
And what the microphone does

722
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,910
is it records these very rapid

723
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,509
changes in air pressure, right?

724
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:26,950
So that's why I see audio waveforms

725
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,589
that look like this.

726
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,109
And so one thing that

727
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,230
one of my teams once did

728
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,950
was collect 100 samples of,

729
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,789
you know, audio waveforms

730
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,470
where somewhere in the middle of it

731
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,069
is someone saying, Robert, turn on.

732
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,150
So, you know, hey, how are you doing?

733
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,710
Oh, yep.

734
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,630
And let's say Robert turn on

735
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,950
and we could now talk about some other things, right?

736
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,910
And so the phrase Robert turn on

737
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,230
takes about one second to say.

738
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:56,069
And one way to collect

739
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:57,910
a constructive training set would be

740
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,109
to take a three second clip.

741
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,950
So this is where Robert turn on was said.

742
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,109
This is where they just finished

743
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:08,789
saying Robert turn on.

744
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,109
And so if you collect

745
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,509
100 audio clips like this,

746
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,150
one way to turn this into

747
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,069
bigger training set is

748
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:20,869
to take these long audio clips

749
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,019
and then this becomes a training example

750
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:29,140
with a label one,

751
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,579
because that's an utterance

752
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,259
where the end of utterances

753
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,460
corresponds to when someone

754
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,140
just finished saying Robert turn on.

755
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,019
And in contrast,

756
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:40,900
this would be an example,

757
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,980
you know, would be a negative example.

758
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,700
Um, and this too is a negative example,

759
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,660
you know, and this too is a negative example.

760
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,940
Does it make sense?

761
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,339
So given a, say, 10 second clip,

762
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,740
given the 10 seconds of audio,

763
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,700
we will have cut out

764
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,180
a phrase where

765
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,660
you get a positive label

766
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
if that three second audio

767
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,539
corresponds to someone just finishing

768
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,500
saying Robert turn on,

769
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,779
which is when you should turn on the lamp

770
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,779
and anything else is labeled zero, right?

771
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,180
And so this is a way to take, say,

772
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:20,339
100 training examples

773
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,180
and turn that into

774
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:24,579
3,000 binary examples.

775
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,420
So 100 audio clips, sorry,

776
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,940
I should say 100 audio clips.

777
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:39,380
And if we take 30 windows out of this,

778
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,980
then you can turn this into,

779
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:46,740
say, 3,000 training examples

780
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,579
equal to binary zero one label

781
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,539
that labels is this moment in time

782
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
when someone just finished

783
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,940
saying the phrase Robert turn on.

784
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,859
So it turns out that if you do this

785
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:02,819
and we did do this,

786
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,460
then we wound up,

787
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:08,500
let's see,

788
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,539
we wound up with a system.

789
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:16,339
So we ran this and tested this on the

790
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,700
depth set.

791
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:21,940
And we wound up with a system

792
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,900
that when trained to predict binary classification

793
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:33,509
was 97% accurate, right?

794
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,670
But it turns out it did this

795
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,269
by outputting zero all the time

796
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:45,190
that had zero detections, right?

797
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,470
And so what this training said,

798
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,390
we basically trained a very large neural network

799
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,150
where I would have gotten

800
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,430
exactly the same result

801
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,630
with that one line of Python code, right?

802
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,430
So this is the kind of stuff

803
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,710
that happens in real life, right?

804
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,670
And by the way,

805
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,950
I'm sharing these stories

806
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,309
not just to entertain you,

807
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,509
though hopefully you're entertained,

808
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:08,390
but because I think of this

809
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,910
by living these experiences

810
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,950
that you go,

811
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,069
oh, I could see this problem.

812
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:12,549
This is what I do.

813
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,990
I could see this problem.

814
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,190
So the question to you is,

815
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,109
if you collect this data,

816
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,789
train the system 97% accuracy,

817
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:21,829
isn't that fantastic?

818
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,509
But you realize that

819
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,630
you just implemented

820
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,390
by a huge neural network

821
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,910
a print zero statement

822
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,390
or the equivalent of print zero

823
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,910
that is never finding

824
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,190
the phrase Robert Turnon.

825
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,269
What do you do next?

826
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:37,430
What's going on?

827
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,150
What do you do next?

828
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:54,200
Cool. Awesome. Right.

829
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,359
So it increases the number

830
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,119
of Robert Turnons in the training example.

831
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,880
This is a very unbalanced training example

832
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,079
and it's great,

833
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:01,640
but just saying,

834
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
I never hear this phrase, right?

835
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,599
How would you go about,

836
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,799
and you or anyone else,

837
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,680
how would you go about

838
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,519
increasing the number of positive examples?

839
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,859
How do you do that?

840
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:22,160
Oh, audio editors.

841
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,720
I see. Wow.

842
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,839
I see. Cool.

843
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,960
Yeah. I see.

844
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,440
Okay. Yes.

845
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:26,720
That will work.

846
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,440
It gets the synthetic data again, right?

847
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,160
Which is actually,

848
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,119
which actually works.

849
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,079
And then it also has

850
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,680
all the complexities of synthetic data,

851
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,279
but it turns out it does work.

852
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,000
So I know it works,

853
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,400
because I've done that too, but yeah.

854
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
I see. Okay.

855
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,250
Yeah. Yep.

856
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,210
That works too.

857
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,369
So one thing you could do

858
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,609
is take your positive examples,

859
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,369
the examples of Robert Turnon

860
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:56,130
and just duplicate those examples,

861
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,730
or maybe just give those examples

862
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,569
more weight to the training objective.

863
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:01,410
Any other ideas?

864
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:12,549
Increase the noise of the example.

865
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,910
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

866
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,349
Yeah. That, that, that, yeah.

867
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:17,109
So a few variations of synthetic variation.

868
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,390
Yep.

869
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,869
So I think the, the, the easy things to try,

870
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:24,710
one would be to take the examples and duplicate it, right?

871
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,470
So, you know, mathematically,

872
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,269
this is equivalent to taking your positive examples

873
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:32,470
and just making multiple copies of that in your training set.

874
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,509
It turns out that will work.

875
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,029
They'll largely solve it.

876
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:37,750
And by the way, unbalanced data sets

877
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,670
is a common issue in training neural networks.

878
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,430
I'll tell you the rule of thumb I use.

879
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,309
And you know, is many neural networks

880
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:45,910
are pretty good at handling

881
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:50,309
up to like a one to 10 ratio of unbalanced data sets.

882
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:53,269
So people often worry what if an unbalanced data set?

883
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:56,789
In this example, we have like a one to 30 ratio

884
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:58,230
and your knowledge may vary.

885
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,750
Sometimes it works, sometimes it won't.

886
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,549
In this case, it didn't work.

887
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,789
But I find that if you have a,

888
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,029
you know, like a one to two ratio,

889
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:08,949
just usually not that worried about it.

890
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,670
Your network is fine training like that.

891
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,710
Maybe up to one to 10 is when I start to worry

892
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,630
about it being a little bit too unbalanced

893
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,269
for, you know, standard training procedures.

894
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:20,309
And when I might do something

895
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,670
to make it a little bit more balanced.

896
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,670
But duplicating these samples will be one tactic.

897
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,670
Yes, so penalize false negatives.

898
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,710
Yes, that will work too.

899
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,550
So I think there are a few ways

900
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,269
to train to change the cost function.

901
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,989
You can give the positive examples more weight

902
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,510
or yes, or penalizing false negatives

903
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,869
will be another way to change the cost function.

904
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:49,429
That will work.

905
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,309
Yes, that will work too.

906
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,829
Yeah, go ahead.

907
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,239
Yeah, yes, so you can also decrease

908
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,760
the number of negative examples.

909
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,880
That will work too.

910
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
The one downside of that is like it's okay.

911
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,679
I think it's fine to do what you said.

912
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,800
The one slight downside is if you are reducing

913
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,960
the diversity of the negative examples,

914
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,800
then your network has just a little bit

915
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,320
less information to learn from.

916
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,239
I think this is small.

917
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,760
What I just said is a small difference.

918
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,039
So I think that will also work.

919
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,719
It's a quick thing to try.

920
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,239
And I'll tell you what my team actually did.

921
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,840
And I'm telling you this not because

922
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
it's a brilliant technique I'm proud of,

923
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
but because I just want to tell you the examples

924
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,800
of the types of hacks that actual commercial

925
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,679
machine learning teams do that actually works.

926
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,719
So I'll tell you what we did.

927
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,320
It was very close to duplicating the positive examples,

928
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,480
but we had just a slightly different variation,

929
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,280
which was, we said that instead of the positive example

930
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,880
being the one window where Robert turned on,

931
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,599
just finish.

932
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,239
So here we're having a sequence of labels, right?

933
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,199
Where zero corresponds to is that moment in time

934
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,199
when someone just finished Robert turned on.

935
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,599
And in the architecture I described,

936
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,880
we are detecting a very, very narrow window in time

937
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,800
where someone just finished Robert turned on

938
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,679
and they got to turn on.

939
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,719
But the hack that we used was actually

940
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,039
just extend this out a little bit.

941
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,119
So instead of saying,

942
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,199
did someone just finish saying Robert turned on

943
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:39,079
and lost 100 milliseconds,

944
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,599
we extended that out to half a second or a second.

945
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,320
And so if someone finished saying Robert turned on

946
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,239
any time they lost half a second,

947
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,840
let's turn on the light, right?

948
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,039
And so this actually generates a few more training examples.

949
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,480
So the reason we did that,

950
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,840
and again, it's a small difference,

951
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,920
is this actually creates a little bit more diversity

952
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,960
in the positive examples than just duplicating it

953
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,719
because now this red rectangle is a positive example

954
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,000
and so is this one and so is this one

955
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,960
and so is this one.

956
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,800
So it just creates a little bit more diversity

957
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,920
in the positive examples.

958
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,360
I expect this will make a very small difference

959
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,159
in the training and the learning algorithms performance,

960
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,960
but it's just, you know,

961
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,119
maybe just slightly better to have slightly,

962
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:24,440
yes, it covers the space of positive examples,

963
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,960
just a little bit better, make sense?

964
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,440
So, okay, just to keep going with the story,

965
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,480
let's say you do this and now

966
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:49,650
you still do well on the training site,

967
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,389
95% accuracy on the training site,

968
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:03,920
but 50% accuracy, so not good enough,

969
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,039
on your dev set, right?

970
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,239
So you fix one problem and another one comes up

971
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,920
and so what do you do next?

972
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,599
Go for it.

973
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,119
Yeah, cool, awesome.

974
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,119
Yep, overfitting, let's use regularization.

975
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,480
Go ahead.

976
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,820
So, right, is it that training and dev set distributions

977
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,699
are not the same?

978
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:36,900
In this example, because we collected the training

979
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,699
and the dev sets,

980
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,860
if we randomly shuffle between training and dev,

981
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,340
they would be the same distribution, actually.

982
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,460
Yeah, but sometimes there's one other thing I do see,

983
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,380
which is if you, it turns out,

984
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
earlier in the history of machine learning,

985
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,539
there was always this assumption of obsession

986
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,780
with making the training set and the dev set

987
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,940
and the test set have the same distribution.

988
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,860
I think it's because if the training set

989
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,699
and the test set have the same distribution,

990
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:05,300
it's easier to prove theorems,

991
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,900
easier to give guarantees, whatever,

992
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,539
so kind of academic machine learning

993
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,059
there was always this, you know,

994
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,179
theoretical assumption,

995
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:14,900
which makes the theory work way better.

996
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,500
The training set and your test set

997
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,260
come from the same distribution, right?

998
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,260
It's just like, from a publishing papers point of view,

999
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,460
that makes life much better.

1000
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,420
For a practical point of view,

1001
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,179
what I see is a lot of the time,

1002
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,539
your training set distribution

1003
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:31,539
is just different than your test set distribution.

1004
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,739
That's just life because, you know,

1005
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,460
it's hard to demand data of a certain sort

1006
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,179
and so, for example, one common thing is,

1007
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,260
if you do use synthetic data generation,

1008
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,619
you can come up with really clever ways

1009
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,300
to generate synthetic training data

1010
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,099
by using TTS or editing audio or whatever.

1011
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,500
There, these techniques let you

1012
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,099
generate a massive training set

1013
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,659
but the price of that is,

1014
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,340
you know, your synthetic data,

1015
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,579
I mean, that's not how users talk, right?

1016
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:02,579
Users don't speak synthetic data,

1017
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:03,699
they speak raw data

1018
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,380
and so to make sure that your test metric

1019
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,059
truly reflects how users will perceive your product,

1020
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,860
you know, I would put true data in your test set

1021
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,619
and so you end up with a lot of systems

1022
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:18,820
where your training set distribution

1023
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,059
is synthetic data or other things you fit it with

1024
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,820
and then your test set is

1025
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,500
what if the world actually cares more about

1026
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,420
and the two distributions is very different

1027
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:29,219
and then I think the question you just asked is,

1028
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,460
is the training set distribution

1029
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,539
too different from the synthetic data

1030
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,340
that is a problem?

1031
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,900
Those would be good questions to ask, right?

1032
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,980
All right, so if you see this,

1033
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,099
this is overfitting

1034
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,619
because we're doing great on training set,

1035
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,139
not so well on dev,

1036
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:48,500
so one thing to try,

1037
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:50,900
first thing to try is very regularization

1038
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,659
so that would be a good thing to try

1039
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,619
and then beyond using regularization,

1040
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,500
I find that for a lot of speech problems,

1041
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,460
if you're overfitting,

1042
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,219
getting more data is nice

1043
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,139
and so just to share with you,

1044
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:05,860
I know, you know, suggestion of synthetic data earlier,

1045
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,579
I'll share with you one thing for synthetic data

1046
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:09,460
that does work,

1047
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,420
which we eventually wound up using,

1048
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,380
which is, it turns out that,

1049
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,780
sorry, this is audio stream, right?

1050
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,059
It turns out that there are a lot of,

1051
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,059
if you can get audio clips of background noise,

1052
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,420
so for example, in this room,

1053
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,019
you know, if I'm not,

1054
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:26,659
if I'm quiet,

1055
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:29,059
we can hear a little bit of air conditioning noise, right?

1056
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:31,860
So a lot of rooms have little background noise

1057
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,300
or if you're near a highway,

1058
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,739
there's cars in the background,

1059
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:36,260
so there are actually most,

1060
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,940
most people where they may use the lab,

1061
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,539
you know, there's a little bit of background noise.

1062
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:44,980
So if you're able to get audio of background noise

1063
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:48,019
and then additionally record

1064
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,139
some very clean audio clips of Robert Turnon,

1065
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,900
it turns out that if you take two audio waveforms

1066
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,659
and sum them together,

1067
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,219
you end up with an audio waveform

1068
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:01,059
that sounds like someone saying this

1069
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,300
in the presence of the background noise, right?

1070
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:06,500
I think it's called the superposition property of sound,

1071
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,780
but basically sound adds,

1072
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,420
which is why if you take two audio clips

1073
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,900
and you just add the audio waveforms together,

1074
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,139
then you end up with an audio recording

1075
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:17,539
that sounds like both sounds going on at the same time.

1076
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,500
So what we can do is take, you know, background noise.

1077
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,820
There's actually a lot of audio clips

1078
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,619
of background noise on YouTube as well and so on

1079
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,300
that check the licensing terms

1080
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,500
before you use stuff like that, right?

1081
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,019
But there are actually quite a lot of openly licensed audio clips

1082
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,579
of, you know, just someone like a quiet,

1083
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,579
like a coffee shop noise

1084
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:44,099
or someone sitting in a house studying or whatever.

1085
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,139
And so if you can take some background noise audio clips

1086
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,820
and then take a clean voice,

1087
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,099
someone saying, Robert Turnon, right?

1088
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,619
And if you add these two together,

1089
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,420
then you end up with background noise,

1090
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,619
Robert Turnon and more background noise.

1091
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:07,940
And this becomes a positive example

1092
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,500
using the process that we talked about just now.

1093
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:14,820
And if you have a handful of clips of Robert Turnon

1094
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,780
and a lot of clips of background noise,

1095
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,019
so you can synthesize the phrase Robert Turnon

1096
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:22,980
and use a lot of different types of background noise

1097
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,820
and create, you know, a pretty large training set.

1098
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:30,420
It turns out one problem with what I just described

1099
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,500
is if you do exactly what I just said,

1100
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,219
you won't actually find a Robert Turnon detector,

1101
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:37,940
you end up with a voice activity detection detector

1102
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,460
because you have a lot of background noise

1103
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,900
and anytime anyone says anything,

1104
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,219
the only thing people say is Robert Turnon.

1105
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,980
It's much easier to just decide,

1106
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,739
is there a loud sound of someone talking

1107
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:47,940
to actually recognize things?

1108
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,619
So the other thing we should do

1109
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,820
is instead of adding Robert Turnon,

1110
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,980
you know, pick a dictionary

1111
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,500
or find other types of audio

1112
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,900
I think that's where you have to comment just now,

1113
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,739
make sure you don't confuse all the things

1114
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,500
and add, I don't know,

1115
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,699
just someone to say the word,

1116
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,980
you know, cardinal or whatever, other words.

1117
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,900
So you have a bunch of examples

1118
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,380
of people saying words other than Robert Turnon

1119
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,059
and then also a bunch of examples

1120
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:14,820
of people saying Robert Turnon.

1121
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,860
And by having a handful of clean recordings

1122
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,739
of Robert Turnon

1123
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,820
and a handful of clean recordings

1124
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,420
of people saying other stuff

1125
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,659
and synthesizing a data set like this,

1126
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:26,019
you can get a data set

1127
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:27,619
with many thousands of examples

1128
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:30,579
of Robert Turnon pretty efficiently.

1129
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:32,739
And if you train a neural network on this,

1130
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,619
you get like a decent wake work

1131
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,380
or trigger work detector.

1132
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:38,900
That make sense?

1133
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,320
So yeah, right.

1134
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,019
So with a process like this,

1135
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,210
so this is what working

1136
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,130
on a machine learning project feels like, right?

1137
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,809
You try something, doesn't work,

1138
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,969
like you find out that you have a skewed data set,

1139
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,769
be creative in how you create and collect data.

1140
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:12,849
You may find that you have a skewed data set

1141
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:13,809
and it just doesn't work.

1142
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:15,170
You may find it's overfitting.

1143
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,250
And I find that it is these,

1144
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:20,690
the ability to drive iterations on a system

1145
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,690
that determines how quickly

1146
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,730
you can get something to work.

1147
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,960
So for the Robert Turnon example,

1148
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:50,530
so if I found that there are a lot of users

1149
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,809
that are listening to music,

1150
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:56,130
then I would probably synthesize data

1151
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,570
with music in the background

1152
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,210
and then have someone say Robert Turnon.

1153
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,010
So if you think a lot of users listen to music

1154
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,210
and there's a desk lamp,

1155
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,570
we want to make sure we catch them

1156
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,610
saying Robert Turnon.

1157
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,090
Then I would probably synthesize more training data

1158
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,409
to include, you know, loudish music

1159
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:16,210
in the background.

1160
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,960
Sorry, what are the genre of music?

1161
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:47,030
Yeah, so it turns out that if you have a,

1162
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,230
I feel like as a rule of thumb,

1163
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,230
if you can have a more diverse set of training data,

1164
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,869
it's usually better, right?

1165
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,829
So maybe I'm not sure what music my user base

1166
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:02,869
likes to listen to the most.

1167
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:03,590
Is it classical?

1168
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,070
Is it rock?

1169
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:04,789
Is it EDM?

1170
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:05,429
Is it whatever?

1171
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:09,989
If you could collect a very rich training set

1172
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:11,670
that includes all of the above

1173
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,670
and even more, then usually they'll do better

1174
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,869
than going too narrow and risking picking wrong.

1175
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:23,349
Yeah, and the one asterisk to what I said

1176
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:26,070
is so long as you can train a neural network

1177
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,829
that's big enough, usually more diverse data,

1178
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,750
more data, more diverse data is better.

1179
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:34,469
If your neural network is too small,

1180
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:35,989
then it may lack the capacity

1181
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,309
on the intelligence to memorize all this stuff,

1182
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:39,829
which could be a problem

1183
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,429
if you need a very small network.

1184
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:42,389
That runs at the edge.

1185
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:47,030
But usually, usually if you have the capacity

1186
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,989
to get more rich, more diverse training data,

1187
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,030
that ends up delivering better results.

1188
00:47:55,030 --> 00:48:06,519
I want to share a view.

1189
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:11,380
So it turns out,

1190
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,019
when you're building a machine learning system,

1191
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,300
very common experience is

1192
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,380
you try something and it doesn't work

1193
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:21,780
and then you have to figure out

1194
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,420
all the wonderful ways it could be not working

1195
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,059
and then go and fix whatever is not working, right?

1196
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,019
And even in this example we went through,

1197
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,340
is the training data too skewed?

1198
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,300
Is it overfitting?

1199
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
So you need either regularization or more data

1200
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,500
or is it something else?

1201
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,940
Or does synthetic data distribution

1202
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,460
not match real data distribution?

1203
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,260
It turns out that when you train your neural network,

1204
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,500
when you train your, when you're building an AI system,

1205
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,860
it's really difficult to know in advance

1206
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,699
what's going to go wrong next.

1207
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:54,500
I find that in software development,

1208
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,099
if I'm writing traditional software,

1209
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,980
you kind of control all the code

1210
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:03,780
and so it's more okay to write a spec

1211
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,900
and then you just build it

1212
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,340
and then it kind of works.

1213
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,539
You still need to debug it,

1214
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:09,699
but the bugs are, it's like my own bugs, right?

1215
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,059
In contrast,

1216
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:12,659
when you're building a machine learning system,

1217
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,579
it's much more like,

1218
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,340
I don't know what's going to happen next, right?

1219
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,260
Maybe because I don't know what the data will give me,

1220
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,219
how to predict how the algorithm will perform.

1221
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,539
And so the workflow of machine learning

1222
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:26,659
feels much more like debugging than development.

1223
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:28,340
And by debugging, I mean,

1224
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,460
it's a process where you build a system

1225
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,219
and you're just repeatedly trying to find

1226
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:35,219
how it doesn't work and fix it.

1227
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:37,780
And if you're trying to do a task that humans can do,

1228
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,820
then the bugs or the gaps in performance

1229
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,619
is often whatever a human can clearly do,

1230
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,539
but the AI system is unable to do.

1231
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,300
So, for many machine learning teams

1232
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,059
that I've led and worked in,

1233
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,820
if you can get the team to a healthy rhythm

1234
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,739
of this debugging cycle,

1235
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,500
you can make really rapid progress.

1236
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,900
So for example, it turns out,

1237
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,940
let me give one example.

1238
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,820
I've been on teams where we would do the following, right?

1239
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,300
And we say morning, afternoon, evening.

1240
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:17,940
So we run our trading jobs at night, right?

1241
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,400
And for example, it turns out,

1242
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,760
for some of these models we're training,

1243
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,519
for speech recognition, it takes, let's say,

1244
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:27,280
it takes four hours, right?

1245
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,199
So the training job takes about four hours

1246
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,159
to train the neural network.

1247
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,440
So training night, in the morning,

1248
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,519
we look at the results,

1249
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:46,119
look at the results, do error analysis,

1250
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,320
try to figure out what's wrong.

1251
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,760
And the afternoon, you know, we write code, right?

1252
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,039
To figure out how we're going to fix

1253
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:57,639
what everything we discovered the day before.

1254
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,559
And then evening, right before we go home,

1255
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,159
we launch the training job.

1256
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:06,679
And then it runs overnight.

1257
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:08,760
And the next morning, we do it again,

1258
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,039
and again, and again.

1259
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,400
And it turns out that if you can fix one problem a day,

1260
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,559
that's actually pretty good.

1261
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:16,840
And within, you know, like, huh.

1262
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,079
And then you saw me walk through three,

1263
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,519
three or four problems.

1264
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:21,960
When I built this for girl,

1265
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,800
there are slightly more problems than that, right?

1266
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,679
But I find that you can get a team and take treatments

1267
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,679
where you train stuff,

1268
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:30,599
look at the results, figure out,

1269
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,079
is this bias, variance, data mismatch?

1270
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:35,159
Oh, actually, this should be cold on good data.

1271
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:38,599
Fix it, you know?

1272
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,239
And then the evening before you go home, launch the job.

1273
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,400
Maybe if you have time in the evening,

1274
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,840
just baby the training job a little bit,

1275
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,039
make sure it's still running.

1276
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,760
But then come back in the next morning to see how it did.

1277
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
Then you just do this over and over.

1278
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,519
It can make really rapid progress.

1279
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,719
And I find there's often this discipline, right?

1280
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:57,320
That, that lets you make progress.

1281
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,960
In contrast, the teams that kind of wake up

1282
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,480
and they go, huh, what do we do next?

1283
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,239
Oh, let's call a meeting this afternoon.

1284
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:04,360
Wait, where's the data?

1285
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,000
Okay, I guess we'll meet tomorrow to look at the data.

1286
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,239
And then, and then like, oh, our infrastructure is down.

1287
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:10,920
And teams like that move much slower

1288
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,280
than the really disciplined teams

1289
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,519
that just keep on rolling forward.

1290
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,039
And one more observation.

1291
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:20,119
It turns out that your iteration cycle,

1292
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:23,400
sometimes it is driven by this.

1293
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,880
So I've worked on machine learning jobs

1294
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,760
where it took us about four hours to train a model.

1295
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,199
And four hours is long enough.

1296
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:31,480
They want to wait for it.

1297
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,639
But, you know, running overnight is just fine.

1298
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,039
I've also worked on teams

1299
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:37,559
where a typical training job

1300
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,960
took about three weeks on average, right?

1301
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,840
And so if it takes three weeks to train a neural network

1302
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,320
for a particular type of model we're working on,

1303
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,079
then the pacing is very different.

1304
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,960
So how long it takes to train a neural network

1305
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,800
really drives the pacing of this

1306
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,079
where sometimes we would, you know, launch a training job

1307
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,199
and then like hope for the best.

1308
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,960
We would want to train during those three weeks.

1309
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,719
It's not that we do nothing for those three weeks,

1310
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:02,039
but you just go launch a training job.

1311
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:04,199
And then frankly, you know, hope that it works

1312
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:06,840
three weeks later, but we take three weeks.

1313
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,079
And then after that, tons of analysis

1314
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:10,360
and debugging and whatever work

1315
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,360
that would take us one to two weeks

1316
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,280
to set us up for the next training job.

1317
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,719
They're going to take us another three weeks

1318
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:16,599
to get the result.

1319
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:19,079
And then we're also parallelizing.

1320
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:20,199
While launching this job,

1321
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:22,039
we're analyzing the job from a previous job

1322
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,880
and we've launched a few jobs asynchronously.

1323
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,360
But I find that how long it takes,

1324
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,159
this is a huge driver for how you do this.

1325
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,039
The other end of the spectrum is

1326
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:34,599
if it takes 10 minutes to train a neural network,

1327
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:35,880
then that's wonderful.

1328
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,039
You just train it, get the result, train it,

1329
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,800
get the coffee, come back, you know,

1330
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,920
then do the analysis.

1331
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,519
And then the bottleneck is how quickly

1332
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,079
can you analyze the data and get more data.

1333
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:47,719
So this really drives the design of this process.

1334
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,119
And one of the things that happens is

1335
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,000
for a lot of projects, you start off with a small thing

1336
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,599
that takes 10 minutes to train,

1337
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,599
but then as you get more and more data,

1338
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,199
you know, then like you're bigger than,

1339
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,480
but now it takes four hours to train.

1340
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,360
It goes in bigger.

1341
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,480
Then it takes two weeks to train.

1342
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,760
It's like, oh, now this thing takes

1343
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,119
a month and a half to train.

1344
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:05,639
So I've experienced that as well

1345
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,440
where unfortunately as a performance climb,

1346
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,960
we decided we had to train bigger

1347
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,039
and bigger models with more and more data.

1348
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:14,199
And then it went from this really fantastic

1349
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,039
10 minute iterations to these like

1350
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,480
months long iterations.

1351
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,599
But they just had to be done

1352
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:21,400
because we were training bigger and bigger networks.

1353
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:22,219
Yeah.

1354
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,849
We probably didn't stop the model that much.

1355
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:41,889
So sometimes you can look at checkpoints

1356
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,369
and if you see that for some reason,

1357
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:48,210
so actually if you're training like a three week job,

1358
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,730
you kind of expect the performance

1359
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,929
to be at a certain level

1360
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:52,690
after a couple of days or after a week.

1361
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,809
And if it's way off,

1362
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:56,289
then before burning another two weeks,

1363
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,769
you may ask, is my learning rate clearly wrong?

1364
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:02,449
Or maybe this new data set we try is clearly wrong.

1365
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:03,650
So you can actually start to run

1366
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,170
some analyses on the checkpoints

1367
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,730
and sometimes we would yank the job

1368
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:08,449
and just kill it.

1369
00:55:08,449 --> 00:55:10,050
I don't see that happen very rarely.

1370
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,300
Yeah.

1371
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:21,619
Yes.

1372
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,860
So what you learn about in the online videos

1373
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,820
is transfer learning.

1374
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,260
We train a large data set

1375
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,260
and then maybe fine tune

1376
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,780
on just a much smaller data set.

1377
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,300
And then if you process a fine tuning

1378
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,579
on a much smaller data set,

1379
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,179
it takes half an hour, right?

1380
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,059
Then that's great.

1381
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:36,900
Then you can also drive much faster iterations

1382
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,739
and that based on that half hours

1383
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:43,409
and let me take back to the training time.

1384
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:43,969
Cool.

1385
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:50,420
One of the reason I obsess about speed

1386
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:58,820
is because it turns out that if the X axis,

1387
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,940
imagine you're building a slot

1388
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,460
to launch this product, right?

1389
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:13,489
I find that if a team takes twice as long to do it,

1390
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,809
they're just much less competitive

1391
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,090
in the marketplace, right?

1392
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:17,969
So here's what I mean.

1393
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:22,449
So if this is error and this is months, right?

1394
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,530
There's some machine learning systems

1395
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:25,650
that we work on for months

1396
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,250
to keep on trying to improve it.

1397
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:30,449
And if this is you

1398
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,519
and if a competitor,

1399
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:37,199
say, takes twice as long

1400
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:38,400
to reach the same level.

1401
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,039
So instead of taking this long to get here,

1402
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:43,039
they take this long to get here.

1403
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,360
Instead of taking this long to get here,

1404
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,800
they take twice as long to get here.

1405
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,679
So the competitor kind of does that, right?

1406
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:50,800
It just takes twice as long.

1407
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,760
You know, they take two days

1408
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,440
instead of one day to do something.

1409
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,199
But it always takes two days

1410
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,800
to do what you would take one day to do.

1411
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,599
Then the performance over time looks like this.

1412
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,929
And what the customer cares about

1413
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:06,130
at a certain moment in time

1414
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,210
is you are so much better than them, right?

1415
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,690
So these two X differences in speed

1416
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,809
really translates into a massive difference

1417
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:15,409
in the performance of your system

1418
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:17,090
versus someone else's system

1419
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,130
in the marketplace.

1420
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:22,210
And I find that the fast-moving teams

1421
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,050
are just so much more effective.

1422
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:24,849
And you might think,

1423
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:27,010
yeah, you know, I took two days.

1424
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,730
They took one day.

1425
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,530
What's the big deal?

1426
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,210
Like, the big deal is not that you're a day slower.

1427
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,969
The big deal is you're two times slower.

1428
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:35,170
And it's very not just in the marketplace.

1429
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,849
It's just not competitive

1430
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:39,570
if you take twice as long

1431
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,050
for some applications.

1432
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:43,510
Okay.

1433
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:46,389
All right.

1434
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:49,909
There's one other example I want to cover.

1435
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:51,269
Let me try to do that quickly.

1436
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,840
So what I've talked about so far

1437
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,400
is speech recognition, wake word detection,

1438
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,079
which is more of an end-to-end

1439
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,119
deep learning system

1440
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:07,400
where your input audio

1441
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,880
goes to the neural network.

1442
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,039
And in this outputs,

1443
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,400
there's this RTO robot turn on, right?

1444
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,000
So the entire system

1445
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,960
you're trying to build

1446
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,559
is just a single neural network.

1447
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,039
For a lot of applications you build,

1448
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:24,199
you end up building pipelines

1449
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:26,119
or sometimes call them cascades.

1450
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,559
So I'm going to use the term pipelines.

1451
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:30,360
We saw one example of this last time

1452
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,079
where to detect people

1453
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,840
coming up to unlock the door

1454
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,440
with face recognition,

1455
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,840
we had video that fed to visual activity detection

1456
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,679
to see if anyone is even in front of it.

1457
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,480
And then that fed to neural network

1458
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,360
to recognize is this an authorized person

1459
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,840
and then 01 to say

1460
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,880
is this a person

1461
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,280
that we should unlock the door for, right?

1462
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,719
What I want to do is use a different example

1463
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:00,920
of a pipeline of an AI deep researcher.

1464
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,699
So it turns out all of the leading alarm,

1465
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:12,340
well, almost all of the leading alarm providers

1466
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,659
have deep researchers

1467
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,219
where you can ask a query

1468
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:18,739
or go and search the internet,

1469
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,099
look at a lot of web pages

1470
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,300
and come back and synthesize

1471
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,300
a very thoughtful report, right?

1472
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:25,780
And so, yeah,

1473
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,860
but I actually use the open AI deep researcher

1474
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,340
quite a lot.

1475
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,860
I think that I know some of the team

1476
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,139
that built it really well,

1477
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:33,380
but I think some of us also did a good job.

1478
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,300
But so, you know,

1479
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,420
you input a query like,

1480
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:40,420
this is example I'm taking

1481
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,980
from the agented AI course online.

1482
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:45,699
But input the query like

1483
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:48,260
show me the latest research on black holes, right?

1484
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,539
Some query like that.

1485
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:56,699
And then one thing you might do

1486
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,940
is take a query like whatever, right?

1487
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,900
Black hole research.

1488
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,869
And then use an LLM,

1489
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:06,469
use a large model

1490
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,909
to generate search terms

1491
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:09,670
to feed to a web search engine.

1492
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:13,030
So it may generate a few terms like,

1493
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,309
you know, black hole research

1494
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:15,670
latest in, I don't know,

1495
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,429
astronomy and black holes or whatever.

1496
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:19,829
So generate a handful of search terms.

1497
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:23,190
This then call out to a web search engine,

1498
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,389
be it server, Google,

1499
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:26,469
data go, Bing, I don't know,

1500
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:28,150
I used to really quite a lot.

1501
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,989
But multiple, actually,

1502
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:31,030
actually more and more

1503
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,710
web search engines designed for AI

1504
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,750
rather than for humans,

1505
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,789
which I think is pretty neat.

1506
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:38,309
So this can call,

1507
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,030
call the web search engine

1508
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:49,559
and then fetch the top URLs.

1509
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:50,840
Oh, sorry.

1510
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,590
I mean, I fetched the top pages,

1511
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,710
other than the top URLs.

1512
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,710
So the web search engine returns 10 pages.

1513
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,710
You may not want to fetch all 10 of them.

1514
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,230
You can read the snippets,

1515
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,230
decide which ones are most relevant.

1516
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,829
Again, maybe with an LLM,

1517
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,190
with a large language model,

1518
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,630
to decide what are the pages

1519
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,429
you want to download.

1520
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:10,630
So just like a human,

1521
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:11,829
you know, do a web search.

1522
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,829
I won't click every single link.

1523
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:14,630
I'll take a glance

1524
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,230
and then decide which ones I'm going to click.

1525
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,510
So identify and fetch the top URLs

1526
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,469
and then feed all that into

1527
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:24,630
right here,

1528
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,949
into writing,

1529
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:30,550
and this gives the final output, right?

1530
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,829
So this is a, by the way,

1531
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:34,469
I think this is a more traditional

1532
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:35,909
de-researcher article,

1533
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:38,789
sorry, de-researcher architecture.

1534
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:40,949
The more modern de-researcher article,

1535
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:42,630
architectures that the system

1536
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,550
decide when to do more web search,

1537
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,869
when to fetch more web pages

1538
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,070
and are more, you know,

1539
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,829
autonomous, more agenting.

1540
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,909
But this is what the early

1541
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,590
de-researcher architectures look like.

1542
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,469
There's more of a linear pipeline.

1543
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:57,989
There are more modern architectures

1544
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,989
where the system will fetch some pages

1545
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:01,190
and autonomously decide,

1546
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,070
do I need to go back

1547
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,030
and do more research

1548
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,230
on some of my topics

1549
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:05,190
and figure it out a few times?

1550
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,710
But this would be like a,

1551
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,829
you know, pretty decent,

1552
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,309
basic de-researcher, right?

1553
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:13,110
And it turns out that

1554
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,230
if you actually build this,

1555
01:02:16,389 --> 01:02:19,539
there, one of the,

1556
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,340
in the speech recognition system,

1557
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,219
Robert Turnon lamp example,

1558
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:26,659
we talk a lot about

1559
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,260
how to improve one component,

1560
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,300
which is the neural network.

1561
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:31,940
If you have a pipeline like this,

1562
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,059
the other thing you need to do,

1563
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:34,500
which is pretty important,

1564
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,300
is to decide

1565
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,300
of all the different components

1566
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,420
in the pipeline,

1567
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,219
which one do you want

1568
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:41,940
to focus your attention on, right?

1569
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,619
So I find that one thing

1570
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:44,980
that makes a huge difference

1571
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,820
in a team's performance

1572
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,179
is, again, being able to drive

1573
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:49,940
a disciplined evaluation

1574
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,860
and error analysis process

1575
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,460
to decide what to work on.

1576
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,980
I find that a lot of machine learning

1577
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,820
is not, you know,

1578
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,099
wildly doing things

1579
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:01,380
to see what works.

1580
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,659
There's actually a very thoughtful,

1581
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:04,260
very disciplined process

1582
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,860
where with the system,

1583
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,380
maybe it's not doing

1584
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,260
as well as we wish,

1585
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:10,820
so we should look at it to decide.

1586
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:12,579
It turns out lots of things

1587
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:13,139
could be wrong.

1588
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:15,699
Is it generating search terms

1589
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:17,380
that aren't quite right, right?

1590
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,179
Or maybe we're using

1591
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:21,139
a web search engine

1592
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,900
that is returning results

1593
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,780
that aren't that good.

1594
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,579
So, for example,

1595
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,260
is my web search engine

1596
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,380
comprehensive enough,

1597
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,739
or is it just, you know,

1598
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:32,340
maybe I picked a lower cost

1599
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,860
web search service or something

1600
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,460
that's just not returning

1601
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,579
the latest materials?

1602
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:37,860
It turns out,

1603
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,260
for some internet articles,

1604
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,300
many web search engines

1605
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,579
would do really well,

1606
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:44,340
but if you ever want to fetch news,

1607
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,619
really fresh news,

1608
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:46,900
there's actually a lot of difference

1609
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,619
in the performance.

1610
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:48,579
Some web search engines

1611
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:49,300
are much better

1612
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,380
at having really fresh content.

1613
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,219
Some just don't update as frequently,

1614
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:54,179
so do I need to switch

1615
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:55,059
web search engines?

1616
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,739
Or am I successfully identifying

1617
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:00,659
the best web pages to fetch?

1618
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:02,579
So if I have black hole signs,

1619
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:04,099
you know, I think nasa.gov

1620
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:04,739
is probably a very

1621
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:06,420
authoritative web page,

1622
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,260
but if a web search engine

1623
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,539
returns, you know,

1624
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:11,539
like, I don't know,

1625
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:14,420
bobsbackdownastronomyblog.com, right?

1626
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,739
That's less authoritative

1627
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:18,019
than nasa.gov.

1628
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:20,739
Am I correctly fetching

1629
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:21,860
the most authoritative

1630
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:22,900
scientific articles

1631
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,420
versus whatever is hyped up,

1632
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,380
you know, or maybe like,

1633
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,420
am I fetching a lot of

1634
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,699
random TikTok videos,

1635
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,780
you know, rather than

1636
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,260
really scientific authoritative things?

1637
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,579
And then lastly,

1638
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:38,099
given all this information,

1639
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,579
am I writing a thoughtful article,

1640
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:41,539
right, with an LM

1641
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,860
from the final research output?

1642
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,139
So it turns out that

1643
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:46,500
with a pipeline like this,

1644
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,539
there are lots of steps

1645
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:48,420
that could go wrong,

1646
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,260
and your ability to

1647
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:52,980
decide what is the components

1648
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,260
you should focus your effort on,

1649
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:56,980
that's a massive driver

1650
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,380
of your productivity

1651
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,460
in improving a system like this.

1652
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:04,900
And the good news is

1653
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,340
that there's actually

1654
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,300
one other thing I've seen.

1655
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,739
Sometimes I've seen a few

1656
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,260
experienced machine learning people,

1657
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,780
it's actually one thing I've seen.

1658
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:16,579
Sometimes a team will

1659
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,619
build a system like this,

1660
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,659
and if it's a less experienced team,

1661
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,699
they'll build a system,

1662
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,059
it's not quite working,

1663
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:24,260
try to decide what to do next.

1664
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,659
One thing I've seen many times is

1665
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:28,980
if you get a few senior

1666
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,579
machine learning people around,

1667
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:32,579
as I've seen this quite a few times,

1668
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:33,460
sometimes the students

1669
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,500
on the project may build

1670
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,699
a system like this.

1671
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,059
If you get a few, you know,

1672
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:38,260
experienced professors

1673
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,619
to look at the system,

1674
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:42,260
you find that our opinions

1675
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,539
on what to do next,

1676
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,260
there's remarkably little variance, right?

1677
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,900
So you find that many,

1678
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,500
you know, experienced AI people

1679
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,539
will look at it and will go,

1680
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:52,980
well, based on what it seems,

1681
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,179
we think this is a problem,

1682
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:54,659
or this is wrong,

1683
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,460
we should try this.

1684
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,739
It's not that we always agree

1685
01:05:56,739 --> 01:05:58,099
with each other 100%,

1686
01:05:58,099 --> 01:05:59,619
but the variance is much less

1687
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:01,059
than you might think.

1688
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:03,539
And to me that, you know,

1689
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:05,699
I think there's a methodology

1690
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:07,619
behind how to approach

1691
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:08,579
these problems,

1692
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:09,539
whereas the variance

1693
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:10,420
and what to try next

1694
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,860
among less experienced engineers

1695
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,219
is much larger, right?

1696
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,380
So to me, I think there's actually,

1697
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:17,860
if you have a systematic way

1698
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,380
of doing error analysis,

1699
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,019
to figure out

1700
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:21,699
where it's actually underperforming,

1701
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:24,500
you know, experienced people

1702
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,059
all kind of,

1703
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:25,940
doesn't mean experienced people

1704
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,500
are always right,

1705
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,619
there's just no variance, right?

1706
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:29,860
But then there really is a methodology

1707
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,139
to figure out what to do next.

1708
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:33,860
And one of the key ideas

1709
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,980
is error analysis.

1710
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:36,900
And I talk about this

1711
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,019
on online videos as well,

1712
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:40,019
but this is so important

1713
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:40,900
and we'll just go through.

1714
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:48,420
And one thing to do

1715
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,539
is to look at the outputs

1716
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:53,460
of each of these intermediate steps

1717
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:55,300
and it's one of these things,

1718
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,420
I know I'll say it,

1719
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,300
you probably even agree

1720
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,420
it's a good idea,

1721
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,780
but the percentage of people

1722
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,739
that actually do it

1723
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:02,019
when the time comes

1724
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,300
are found to be far lower

1725
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,139
than 100%, right?

1726
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:06,579
But there's just, you know,

1727
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,739
take a handful of queries,

1728
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:11,139
be it, is it latest

1729
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:12,099
in black hole science

1730
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:13,139
or should I rent

1731
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:14,820
or buy an apartment

1732
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,179
or, you know,

1733
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:17,860
what's the, what are,

1734
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,059
help me make fun plans

1735
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:20,340
for a weekend in Santa Cruz,

1736
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,340
whatever, some handful of queries

1737
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,380
for a deep researcher.

1738
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
And then look at what search terms

1739
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,619
it generates

1740
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:29,139
and see if it makes sense.

1741
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:30,900
Look at the web pages and fetches,

1742
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,780
see if they look good.

1743
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:34,900
Look at the top pages and fetch

1744
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,460
and see if the top web pages selected

1745
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,420
is similar

1746
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,940
or if it's materially different

1747
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:40,900
than what you would pick.

1748
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,099
Like my example,

1749
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,019
one of this decides to fetch

1750
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:46,340
Bob's Backup Astronomy page.com

1751
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,940
rather than nasa.gov, right?

1752
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,820
Then you go, okay,

1753
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,260
maybe I need to change how to do that.

1754
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,579
And then also look at the final writing

1755
01:07:52,579 --> 01:07:54,659
to see given the source articles

1756
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,659
is it writing the appropriate articles.

1757
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,260
And what I find is

1758
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,219
for a process like this,

1759
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:06,739
you know, it turns out error analysis

1760
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:09,780
is often a very manual process

1761
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,579
because when the system isn't performing

1762
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,300
error analysis or gap analysis

1763
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,539
is often a manual process of

1764
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:19,460
figuring out what a human would do

1765
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,539
that is better than what the AI system would do.

1766
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,899
And we're trying to inject knowledge

1767
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:26,579
from the human into the AI system.

1768
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:28,659
So because AI doesn't have this knowledge yet,

1769
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,739
usually you do need a human time to do this.

1770
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:33,539
And I know, you know,

1771
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:34,899
and people are talking about automating

1772
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:35,380
some of this

1773
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,060
and maybe there'll be problems there.

1774
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,979
But so far I find error analysis,

1775
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:41,060
it just takes human to look at it

1776
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,420
and have the insights into

1777
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,340
where AI system is doing something different

1778
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,020
than an expert human would be.

1779
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,060
And it's that insight

1780
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,899
that then points you in the direction

1781
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:49,939
for how to improve it.

1782
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,460
And so often I would build a spreadsheet like this

1783
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,460
where I have a query that is,

1784
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,659
you know, black hole science.

1785
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:03,479
Another one, do I rent versus buy,

1786
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:07,079
you know, in whatever, San Francisco

1787
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:13,640
or, you know, weekend activities in Santa Cruz, right?

1788
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,840
Whatever, just have, I don't know,

1789
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,960
maybe up to a hundred.

1790
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,479
I find that I often have patients

1791
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,319
look at up to a hundred examples,

1792
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:22,119
beyond a hundred,

1793
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,960
sometimes more than a hundred,

1794
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,720
but it's somewhere between ten and a hundred.

1795
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,960
Have a list of queries

1796
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,079
and have a list of steps.

1797
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,239
And so the steps would be, right, search terms,

1798
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:38,020
what's that, web search,

1799
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:43,750
fetch pages.

1800
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,739
So this is what it feels like to do error analysis.

1801
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:00,659
It is a labor intensive process

1802
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:01,859
because there's a process of

1803
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,739
identifying where a human outperforms AI

1804
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,100
to try to close the gap, right?

1805
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,220
Just do this over and over.

1806
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:09,140
But so what I would do is,

1807
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,220
I'll sit down often with a spreadsheet

1808
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,979
in front of me open like this,

1809
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,500
and I will run, you know,

1810
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,739
black hole science through the whole system

1811
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:18,020
and then just read,

1812
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,779
are the search terms satisfactory?

1813
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,100
And if I'm not an expert in black hole science,

1814
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,380
I may need to get an expert

1815
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,779
or do a bit of work to figure that out.

1816
01:10:25,779 --> 01:10:28,340
But if I find that the search terms

1817
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,539
to send to a web search engine

1818
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:30,819
are completely satisfactory,

1819
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:32,420
then I just say, okay, this one's good.

1820
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,739
Then given those search terms,

1821
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:36,579
I'll look at the web search results and say,

1822
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:38,340
huh, did the web search engine

1823
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,100
retrieve reasonable things?

1824
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,939
And it looks good, then great.

1825
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:44,020
And then I look at,

1826
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,739
did my system, maybe in LLM,

1827
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:48,100
did it make a good choice

1828
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,739
in the top web pages to actually go and fetch?

1829
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:53,300
And maybe I found this retrieving,

1830
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,260
it chose to retrieve Bob's backup astronomy blog,

1831
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,699
but skip NASA.gov.

1832
01:10:57,699 --> 01:11:00,659
Then I'll say, okay, there's a problem there, right?

1833
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:02,260
And then often to make a note, you know,

1834
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:07,300
Bob instead of NASA, right?

1835
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,779
Just to kind of just take notes on what you're seeing.

1836
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,420
And then I'll say, given these sources,

1837
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,539
is this writing okay?

1838
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:14,340
Maybe it's okay.

1839
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:19,460
And then the process is to take a handful,

1840
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:23,220
somewhere between 10, 20, and 100 of articles

1841
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,220
where the performance is subpar.

1842
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,659
And it's called error analysis

1843
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:29,619
because I want to focus on where it's underperforming, right?

1844
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,579
So there's some articles

1845
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:31,859
where it's doing a great job on,

1846
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,060
I would tend to pay less attention to those.

1847
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:40,100
But I focus on finding anywhere from 10, 20, to 100 queries,

1848
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,859
where it's clearly underperforming

1849
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:44,180
what I think a human should be doing

1850
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,180
or what I hope should do.

1851
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,779
And then going through to just try to get a sense

1852
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:51,380
of how often the hotspots

1853
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,140
are in different parts of the pipeline.

1854
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:55,539
And so maybe for rent versus buy,

1855
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,539
I might say, boy,

1856
01:11:57,539 --> 01:11:59,380
there's a really authoritative blogger

1857
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,180
that talks about this,

1858
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,859
but somehow web search misses.

1859
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:02,260
I don't know.

1860
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,020
Maybe I'm using the wrong web search engine.

1861
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,899
We can in Santa Cruz, yes,

1862
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:11,460
it's buying into some hyped up tourist things

1863
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,300
rather than actually finding

1864
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,220
locally interesting webpages and so on.

1865
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:21,699
And then by doing this for 20, 30, 50 queries,

1866
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:23,779
you can then start to get a sense

1867
01:12:23,779 --> 01:12:26,420
of where the hotspots are, right?

1868
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,060
So again, all of these are subpar results.

1869
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,819
I'm focusing on queries

1870
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:33,060
where the performance is not good enough.

1871
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:36,180
And then if I find that, you know,

1872
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,180
I don't know, 40% of the time

1873
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,340
it's failing to fetch the top webpages.

1874
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,260
Only 5% of the time, right,

1875
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,220
it's failing to do that.

1876
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,899
Actually, because of the issues.

1877
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:47,060
They find that 70% of the time

1878
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,180
I'm really not happy with this.

1879
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,579
5% of the time web search is not good enough.

1880
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,819
You know, maybe 20% of the time

1881
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,500
search terms are wrong

1882
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,979
and maybe 20% of the time

1883
01:12:56,979 --> 01:12:58,340
the writing is not good enough.

1884
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,579
These don't have to add up to 100%.

1885
01:13:00,579 --> 01:13:02,899
Sometimes you have problems in one column.

1886
01:13:02,899 --> 01:13:05,140
But if this is what it turns out to be,

1887
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:09,380
then we'll go, well, clearly a lot of the,

1888
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,899
my dissatisfaction of results

1889
01:13:10,899 --> 01:13:12,899
is because it's just not choosing good pages

1890
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,739
from the web search to return.

1891
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:16,180
So let me go focus on that.

1892
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:19,300
And the thing about a lot of machine learning systems

1893
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,340
is you just don't know

1894
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,380
if you don't do this error analysis ahead of time

1895
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,100
in terms of what component to focus on.

1896
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:28,979
And so I find that teams that know

1897
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,659
how to drive this process systematically

1898
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,140
and it sometimes takes us hours.

1899
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,220
And we're that, you know, daily schedule thing.

1900
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,500
Sometimes it takes us a few hours

1901
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,899
to go through this process to reach conclusions.

1902
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:44,579
But then the benefit of spending like whatever,

1903
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:46,020
you know, three, four hours on this

1904
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:48,739
is that it can save you weeks

1905
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:50,899
of otherwise heading in the wrong direction.

1906
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:53,619
So teams can drive this

1907
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,579
evalus and error analysis process

1908
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:58,819
in a very methodological way.

1909
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:02,899
You're much better picking what direction to work in

1910
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:06,020
and that allows your team to go way faster.

1911
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,859
And there's way more than a 2x difference.

1912
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:10,100
So I've actually literally visited teams

1913
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,939
that have been working on something for six months.

1914
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:13,699
I go, like, gee, you know,

1915
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,140
I could have told you six months ago

1916
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,739
this wasn't going to cut it, right?

1917
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:19,380
And then imagine if this was the problem,

1918
01:14:19,939 --> 01:14:23,300
we're not writing the right web pages,

1919
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,140
but, you know, for some reason,

1920
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,420
the team kept on trying out different web search engines.

1921
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,699
Maybe there's someone trying to sell

1922
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,300
a new web search service to you.

1923
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,979
So, you know, spend a lot of time with the sales team,

1924
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:34,739
do a lot of integration with the web search.

1925
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:36,659
There's actually more web search services

1926
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:37,699
than most people know, right?

1927
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:39,939
So, and I actually swap between them

1928
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:41,060
whenever I feel like it.

1929
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,619
So imagine you spend all your time

1930
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:45,939
trying to come up with a better web search service,

1931
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:46,979
you know, for six months,

1932
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:49,539
at least entirely possible.

1933
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:51,140
Then you could just,

1934
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,659
it just won't move the needle

1935
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:53,859
for the overall performance,

1936
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:56,420
which is why the cyber error analysis process

1937
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,180
is so important, right?

1938
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,739
I walked through this with the example of one pipeline.

1939
01:15:00,739 --> 01:15:03,779
The online videos go through other examples as well,

1940
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:06,420
but both building deep learning pipelines

1941
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,220
is for kind of AI agentic pipelines.

1942
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,340
I think this is a very important concept to master.
